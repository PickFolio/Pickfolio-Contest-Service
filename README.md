# PickFolio Contest Service üèÜ

The core gameplay engine for PickFolio. This service manages the entire lifecycle of contests, from creation and joining to portfolio management and live score updates. It acts as a secure Resource Server, validating JWTs issued by the Auth Service to authorize user actions.

## Core Responsibilities

* **Portfolio Management**: Manages players' virtual cash balances and their portfolio holdings.
* **Transaction Processing**: Processes BUY and SELL transactions, interacting with the Market Data Service to validate symbols and get live prices.
* **Live Score Updates**: Listens for real-time price broadcasts from the Market Data Service via a WebSocket, recalculates portfolio values, and broadcasts live score updates to players via its own STOMP WebSocket.
